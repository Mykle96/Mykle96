# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Magnus Myklegard! I am a student of ICT and Engineering at NTNU (Norwegian Univeristy of Science and Technology).
I do most of my projects on my free time, which is limited now as I also work as a Senior Key Account Manager for one of Norway's largest festivals, completely run by nearly 2000 volunteer students.
